## About

You can use this add-on to add support for Easywave devices in Home Assistant.  Easywave is a proprietary protocol for wireless devices, developed by [Niko](https://niko.eu) & [Eldat](https://www.eldat.de/).

This add-on requires the presence of an [RX09 USB Transceiver](https://www.eldat.de/produkte/schnittstellen/rx09e_en.html) in the machine.

**This project is still in alpha phase, but is usable after some manual tweaking.**
